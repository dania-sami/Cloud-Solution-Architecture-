# Azure AI Talking Avatar

This project is an interactive talking avatar that speaks like a human and introduces me as a candidate for Microsoft. It is designed so a recruiter or hiring manager can feel how I present myself and how I explain technology in a clear way.

You can click on different skill cards such as communication or stakeholder management and the avatar tells a short story about how I use that skill in real life. At the same time the text appears as a smooth script so it can be read or listened to.

This lets me show communication cloud thinking and self awareness in one place. It runs in any modern browser and does not need installation.

How to run

Open index.html in your browser and click one of the skill cards.
