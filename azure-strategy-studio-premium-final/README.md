# Azure Strategy Studio

This project is a premium level interactive cloud storytelling tool. It shows how I think about cloud architecture, communication, and stakeholder needs in a simple and powerful way.

When you open the project you can switch between different personas like CTO CFO Security Officer or Product Lead. The entire view changes based on what that person actually cares about. This is how real cloud conversations work in the industry and this project shows that I understand that.

It highlights key Azure services like Azure Front Door App Service Azure Functions Static Web Apps Azure SQL Cosmos DB Storage and Azure Monitor. It also adapts which metrics matter the most for each persona such as availability latency cost posture or feature delivery speed.

I built this to show more than technical skills. It shows presentation ability business understanding and the capacity to communicate cloud ideas clearly and confidently. It works instantly in any browser and does not require installation.

Open index.html and the studio runs immediately.
